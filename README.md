# Ranking_CV
This project focuses on automatically ranking Curriculum Vitae (CVs) based on relevance to a specific job description using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The system parses CVs, extracts key features, compares them against job criteria, and outputs a relevance score or ranking to streamline candidate evaluation.
